`Dockerfile` and other files for running OAC/Calisphereâ€™s XTF in
AWS elastic beanstalk

# notes

## build docker image locally

```
docker build -t tag .
```

## fix date skew (for AWS)

```
boot2docker ssh sudo date -u -D %Y%m%dT%T --set="$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%T)"
```

## launch the docker image

when testing

```
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 --env-file file tag
```

in `file` set:
```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
XTF_LAYOUTS=s3://.../xtf-includes-layouts-sections.tar.gz
XTF_INDEX_TAR=s3://.../indexes/...tar
```

XTF should then be running on `http://192.168.59.103:8080/xtf/search`

## clean up

```
docker rm $(docker ps -aq)
docker rmi $(docker images --filter dangling=true --quiet)
```
